/*
1. Make a guess at the answer (you can pick n/2 as your initial guess).
2. Compute r = n / guess
3. Set guess = (guess +r)/ 2
4.Go back to step 2 for as many iterations as necessary. The more you repeat steps
2 and 3, the closer guess will become to the square root of n .
Write a program that inputs a double for n , iterates through the Babylonian algorithm five times,
and outputs the answer as a double to two decimal places. Your
answer will be most accurate for small values of n .
